Each line represents a year, and each facet represents a month, which helps visualize seasonal cycles. Typically, you’ll notice higher flows in spring/early summer and lower flows in late summer/fall. The “subseries” are the flow values for each month across the years, showing consistent seasonal peaks and troughs."
